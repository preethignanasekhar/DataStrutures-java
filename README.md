# Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms with Java 🚀
Are you ready to dive into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)? Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or just looking to enhance your problem-solving skills, mastering DSA is key to writing efficient code.

Here’s how Java can help you ace your DSA journey! 🖥️💡
# Stacks and Queues 🧱
Stacks follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, while queues follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Learn how these simple structures are used for efficient data handling in algorithms like Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS).
# Linked List Implementation in Java 🌐
A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains two parts:

Data 📊 - The value stored in the node.
Next 🔗 - A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.
Unlike arrays, linked lists don't require contiguous memory locations. Each node can be scattered in memory, with the link to the next node providing the connection between them.

# Types of Linked Lists 📜
Singly Linked List ➡️ Each node points to the next node in the list.
Doubly Linked List 🔄 Each node points to both the next and the previous node.
Circular Linked List 🔁 The last node points back to the first node, creating a loop.
# Operations ⚙️
Insertion ➕: Add a new node.
Deletion ➖: Remove a node.
Traversal 🚶: Visit each node.
Search 🔍: Find a node with a particular value.
